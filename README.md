# MarisaOJ Solutions

**MarisaOJ** is an online judge platform created by former students of Amsterdam High School in Vietnam. It is designed with a structured roadmap to help learners approach Competitive Programming more efficiently and strategically.

While I am not an official staff member of MarisaOJ, I would like to share my accepted solutions on the platform for reference and consultation purposes.

**Important Notes**:
- **Please do not copy my codes and submit them directly to MarisaOJ.** Doing so provides no learning benefit and is a misuse of your time.
- Instead, review the solutions critically, understand the logic, and try to improve upon them.

If you have ideas for better solutions or optimizations, I encourage you to share them! Feel free to reach out to me via my Facebook account or email.

Best of luck in your Competitive Programming journey, champ!
