# MarisaOJ_Solutions
MarisaOJ is an Online Judge made by former students of Amsterdam High School in Vietnam. Having a roadmap to help everyone learn Competitive Programming more efficient and strategically.

I myself am not a staff member of the OJ, but I would like to share my solutions which got accepted on the OJ for consulting purpose.

Please don't copy my codes and submit them directly on the OJ, since:
- You would gain nothing from doing so.
- It is a waste of time.

I encourage you to share if you have any better idea compared to my solution. Contact me via facebook account or emailing me.

Good luck with your study, champ!
